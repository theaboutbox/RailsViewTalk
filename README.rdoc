== Rails View Talk

This is an example for an app that allows users to sign up, pick a nonprofit and an
event and have a fundraising page.

We go through a few steps (implemented via git tags)

step_1 - simple registration, prompt users to choose event, nonprofit
step_2 - Use radio buttons instead of select boxes
step_3 - One mondo registration form
step_4 - Multi-step form impelmented via state machine

To add events/nonprofits, etc, to to /admin - this uses rails_admin
